# NFT Creation and Deployment  

This project involves creating and deploying NFTs representing **Tunisian money**. It utilizes off-chain storage via **IPFS**, with the smart contracts developed in **Solidity** and deployed using **Python** and **Brownie**.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Solidity**: For writing smart contracts.  
- **Python**: To interact with smart contracts and manage deployment scripts.  
- **Brownie**: A Python-based development and testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts.  
- **IPFS**: Decentralized file storage for off-chain NFT metadata and assets.  

## 🌍 Live Project  

You can explore the live project on **OpenSea Testnet** here:

**Note:** The link may not work due to unknown issues with OpenSea. If you encounter problems, the NFTs can still be accessed on the blockchain through direct contract interaction.  

## 📚 Project Overview  

The NFTs in this collection are representations of **Tunisian currency**, digitized and deployed to the blockchain. Metadata and artwork are stored off-chain on **IPFS**, ensuring secure and decentralized asset management.  

### Key Features:  
- **Custom Metadata**: NFTs include detailed metadata representing Tunisian currency.  
- **Off-Chain Storage**: Media assets stored on IPFS to optimize on-chain gas costs.  
- **Interoperability**: Fully compliant with ERC-721 standards for maximum compatibility.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites:  
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your system.  
- [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html) for deployment and testing.  
- A wallet (e.g., [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)) configured to use Ethereum testnets.
